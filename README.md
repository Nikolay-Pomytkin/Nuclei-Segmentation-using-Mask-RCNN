# Nuclei-Segmentation-using-Mask-RCNN

Goal of this project was to create an algorithm to automate nucleus detection from biomedical images.
By automating nucleus detection, we could help unlock cures fasterâ€”from rare disorders to the common cold.

# Model Oveview

For this competition, I modified [Matterport's](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) implementation of Mask-RCNN deep neural network for object instance segmentation. I adapted the existing model configurations to detect small nuclei in images with varying size and modality. To ensure that the model doesn't overfit, I used image augmentation on all the train dataset.

- `mrcnn` folder contain the model files and configuration from Mask-RCNN.
- `main.py` has wrapped up everything from training to detection.

# Command Line Usage

Train a new model starting from ImageNet weights using train dataset (which is stage1_train minus validation set)

`python3 nucleus.py train --dataset=/path/to/dataset --subset=stage1_train --weights=/path/to/weights.h5`

Resume training a model that you had trained earlier

`python3 nucleus.py train --dataset=/path/to/dataset --subset=train --weights=last`

Generate submission file from stage1_test images

`python3 nucleus.py detect --dataset=/path/to/dataset --subset=stage1_test --weights=<last or /path/to/weights.h5>`

### Notebook to be uploaded soon for the inspecting of test dataset.
